This is a representative story based on the life of Queen Anne Boelyn, where you can take on her role and make decisions she actually faced in Tudor England. Vie for as much power as you can and try to become the Queen of England by making the correct decision, and get executed or become a nun if you make a mistake! This game was created using Twine, and written with Markdown to create an interactive story which includes images, visual effects, and variables.
